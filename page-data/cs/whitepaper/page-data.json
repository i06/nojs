The \\\"hash\\\" of a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all transactions in the block. A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of intermediate nodes where each node is the hash of its two children, and finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two children, representing the \\\"top\\\" of the tree. The purpose of the Merkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: a node can download only the header of a block from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from another source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct. The reason why this works is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and therefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a completely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof-of-work).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term sustainability.

A protocol known as \\\"simplified payment verification\\\" (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called \\\"light nodes\\\", which download the block headers, verify the proof-of-work on the block headers, and then download only the \\\"branches\\\" associated with transactions that are relevant to them.

Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD).

Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud.\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"identity-and-reputation-systems\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h3\",\n    \"href\": \"#identity-and-reputation-systems\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"identity and reputation systems permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"header-anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"svg\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n    \"focusable\": \"false\",\n    \"height\": \"16\",\n    \"version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n    \"width\": \"16\"\n  }, mdx(\"path\", {\n    parentName: \"svg\",\n    \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n    \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n  }))), \"Identity and Reputation Systems\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"http://namecoin.org/\"\n  }, \"Namecoin\"), \", attempted to use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to provide a name registration system, where users can register their names in a public database alongside other data.

Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30% hashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will have a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the other 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get mining data immediately) whereas B will have a risk of producing a stale block 90% of the time. Thus, if the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to be high, A will be substantially more efficient simply by virtue of its size.

Additionally, Turing-incompleteness is not even that big a limitation; out of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far only one required a loop, and even that loop could be removed by making 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code. Given the serious implications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why not simply have a Turing-incomplete language? In reality, however, Turing-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the problem. To see why, consider the following contracts:\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\"\n  }, \"C0: call(C1); call(C1);\\nC1: call(C2); call(C2);\\nC2: call(C3); call(C3);\\n...\\nC49: call(C50); call(C50);\\nC50: (run one step of a program and record the change in storage)\\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, send a transaction to A. Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a contract that takes up 2\", mdx(\"sup\", null, \"50\"), \" computational steps. Miners could try to detect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value alongside each contract specifying the maximum number of computational steps that it can take, and calculating this for contracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require miners to forbid contracts that create other contracts (since the creation and execution of all 26 contracts above could easily be rolled into a single contract). Another problematic point is that the address field of a message is a variable, so in general it may not even be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will call ahead of time. Hence, all in all, we have a surprising conclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, and the lack of Turing-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult to manage unless the exact same controls are in place - but in that case why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"currency-and-issuance\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h3\",\n    \"href\": \"#currency-and-issuance\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"currency and issuance permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"header-anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"svg\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n    \"focusable\": \"false\",\n    \"height\": \"16\",\n    \"version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n    \"width\": \"16\"\n  }, mdx(\"path\", {\n    parentName: \"svg\",\n    \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n    \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n  }))), \"Currency And Issuance\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, which serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and, more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees.
